# Access files through Microsoft Teams

Files are accessible through Microsoft Teams which has an Integration with SharePoint. This will show you how to access files through Microsoft Teams.

1. Open a browser and navigate to "**https://teams.microsoft.com/**" or download and install the application from "[**https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/download-app**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/download-app)".

2. Click on "**General**" under a team, and then click on "**Files**". If you don't see any teams, that means that you don't have the correct permissions.
